Big-O Notation Basics

Big-O tells us how fast an algorithm grows as input size increases.

O(1) → Constant time → Always takes same time (independent of input size).
Example: Accessing arr[0].

O(n) → Linear time → Time grows in proportion to input size.
Example: Looping through an array once.

O(n²) → Quadratic time → Time grows proportional to square of input size.
Example: Nested loops (checking all pairs in an array).
